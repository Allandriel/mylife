<p>Greetings,
Before I ask my question first I think it’s the best to write a couple words about myself, this way you can feel more how I feel and how my world look like.
I am 26 year old man living in Poland in one of major cities. I am employee one of biggest investment banks in the world. This is a new journey for me because it’s been only 2 months since I started, and I can tell that I love what I do every day.
Since I was little boy I loved computer games, especially the online one and I started playing them at the age of 14. This small but I think significant moment change my life forever and the results of this I think are my psychological problems right now.
Sitting every day many hours in front of computer closed me socially, in last years I even think that the problems is not me but the world outside, so I pushed everyone and everybody out of my life. I think I am an open person, and most of people I met in my life can get instant connection to me, maybe because I like to express things and I am not afraid to tell things that other people would reconsider too personal to tell before closer knowing each other. 
Right now I am at deepest place in my entire life, when I should been happy every day. I talk to almost no one. I rarely leave my room and go outside to meet people in the town. I had idea that the pain I feel inside from some time it’s a reason of not me but people I surround myself. I have broken up with my girlfriend after over 3 years of ups and downs (mostly downs), which I loved with my heart, but I was too tired of all the arguing and problems we could not solved via simple communication (there was no mutual understanding and no communication). Let’s say that I am single for over a 2 weeks now, but we have broken up and get back to each other so many times I could not even count (I would say over 20 times in past 3 years?). So I don’t feel like it’s a 2 weeks and please don’t confuse my problems with broken love sick, it’s one of the problems of my emotional status right now but I don’t think it’s a biggest one.
I don’t think I have any real friend, only people that show up and are gone depending on where I live or what I do in current moment. But I really love talk and meet other people deep inside, I feel happy when I can exchange my thoughts with someone, but It’s a big surprise for me If I see a new message on my phone from person who don’t want something for me.
I am a lazy person with big ambitions. This two things collide and put total chaos in my life, which I am not controlling right now. I work as a Webmaster so my life is connected to the Internet all the time. This lead to Internet addiction, for many years now, let’s say over 5 years now I have been wasting my time on computer games and watching videos on YouTube or reading things I think are interesting. I have cut down playing games to none right now, I have deleted all of them from my PC. And I am free for 2 weeks now for what I am proud (It’s a result of feeling ashamed and the pain whenever I start any of them). But surprisingly this “achievement” changed nothing. Right now I am spending more time doing insignificant things like watching over and over again similar clips on YouTube or wasting time over the internet.
My ambition tells me that I should do something more and learn every day to be a better webmaster or graphic designer but I have no strength left in me to do so for long period of time. Even writing this brings me so much pain and I reconsider to not write it longer. (There is question in my head right now why I am doing this? For what reason? Who could possibly help me?) I feel like have nothing else to do and I see my PC as a window for the world, desperately trying to reach for any attention to someone notice me, feel my pain, help me somehow, tell me something nice from time to time. I wake up at 6:30 AM and go back from work around 5:00 PM, the first thing I do when I enter my room is start my PC, and before I go to sleep around midnight I “fade” in front of the screen.
I see myself as an attractive man, I also had an attractive ex-girlfriend (no bragging, just explaining). But sitting on the chair every day leads me to staying skinny (181cm height, 67kg weight), I never had a gens to be fat. I would like to go to the gym but I feel ashamed of myself and I think people would judge me and I have little motivation to do so. I want to have an attractive girl again (but this time the one I can communicate as a human being to human being) at least similar lever. I know how hard is to do so for me right now. I see all those girls all over internet with perfect faces, perfect bodies and I cannot feel urge to want to know how it is to have such person next to you every day. I don’t have car, not much money either. I know it’s not important thing when it comes to relationship but it sure helps, no one can deny that.
Beside internet I have also a smoking addiction, not even cigarettes but marihuana also. If the second one was not so expensive I would probably smoke it very day just to feel a little better (it sure helps me feel better but makes me even more lazier).
I cannot function normally right now, anything I feel is pain, so much pain that my head hurts, my chest hurts and it comes like waves on the sea. I want to regain control of my life, but I want to do it myself, If I would go to specialist for help I would not feel like it’s my achievement, but someone else. And everything I do I must feel like I have done it myself, in other way I would feel no pleasure about it at all. In last months I have suicidal thoughts, I would probably never do nothing to myself (I would be ashamed what would people thought about me afterwards – maybe I would gain some social attention, and definitely devaste my family) but I fear if I reach some breaking point what could I do. Sometimes I wonder how it feels if I stabbed myself into my heart, or is the blood really warm if it flows from my wrists?
I have so much, yet I have so little. I do a lot, yet I do so little. I could be happy, yet I am not.
What to do? Where to go? What to see?
How regain control?
